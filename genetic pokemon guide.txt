Players as chromosomes in a population:
 
each Player has a team of 6 random pokemon from gen1, which we will call the allele (len 6)

one cycle goes as follows:

1. Each Player will play against every other Player in the population
2. We evaluate the fitness of each Player, which is the number of wins obtained
3. We do a weighted selection of the Players for crossover in the next generation
4. We produce the new population of Players via crossover, where the allele is the pokemon in the team (kind of like trading)
   (We'll make a new random name)
5. We have a small mutation chance to randomly generate a new pokemon in the team
6. Repeat :)
